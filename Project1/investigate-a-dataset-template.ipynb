    "> **Tip**: You should _not_ perform too many operations in each cell. Create cells freely to explore your data. One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",

Follow every code cell, or every set of related code cells, with a markdown cell to describe to the reader what was found in the preceding cell(s).
