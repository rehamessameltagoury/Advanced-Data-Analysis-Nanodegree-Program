One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",
